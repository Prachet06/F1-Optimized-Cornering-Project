## Purpose of auto_screenshot.py
Used to automate the process of capturing image data that the CNN trains on.

This is done by detecting each time when I hit the brakes ingame i.e. press or press and hold the L2 button on the PS5 DualSense controller. When this is detected, a screenshot of the monitor (that is specified in the script) which is being used for displaying the game is taken.
